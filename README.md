it # db_project
This is project that was originally for a class but I have been occasionally working on for practice.

The purpose is to give a rough representation of a delivery system (eg ups/usps) that contains a ui, db, and limited functionality. It also contains all the instructions and scripts needed to quickly setup the db and populate it with test data. A more detailed readme is in the folder.
